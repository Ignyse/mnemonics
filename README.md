# Mnemonics
## Purpose
The goal of this program is to create my own mnemonics for different languages, to learn the vocabulary fast. 
Languages I want to include: german, spanish, english, japanese.

## Technical
I want to code in python, using tkinter (Never used before, but seems as a simple GUI )
It is only supposed to work locally on my computer.

## TO DO
* When going to new word
  1. first show the word
  2. Option to show the mnemonic
  3. Option to show the meaning
* Option to have modes:
  1. Random words each time you go next
  2. You can input the page where they are all sorted originally so just go through all by inputing a number
  3. Only show those that don't have mnemonics?
## Additional 

Maybe:
pip install customtkinter
